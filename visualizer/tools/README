So it would be nice if we had our own bitmap font builder.  
What needs to happen is we need to be able to input a 
desired image size, a desired font size, desired font, 
etc. etc. 

The builder will then output a png with 1 letter each in 512
squares.  A meta file would also be created: fontName.png.meta

This will contain the height and width of each character. 
Python Imaging Library should make all of this possible:
