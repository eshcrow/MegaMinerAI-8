This file will contain the guidelines for the tool that we should have for the sprite builder.
spriteBuilder python tool

usage:
python spriteBuilder path [regexp]
 --outSize x y        - When this parameter is passed to the tool, it will automatically
                        resize it to the dimensions x and y.
 -o outPath           - Where to store the resulting file.  Defaults to current directory

The first thing spriteBuilder will have to do is search the given directory for any files 
that matches the given regular expressions in 'regexp' or just take all files in there by 
default. 

Once the list of files has been accumulated, you will need to open one to find out it's image 
size, (x, y)

* NOTE: x and y should be a power of 2, but not necessarily square.  In the future, it would
 be nice if we could use non-power of 2 sprites and have this tool automatically compensate,
 but it's not required at the moment.

So once you've determined what each image size will be (and they all have to be the same size), 
you will need to calculate the optimal output image size based on this input image sequence.  

Examples:
  Image Size     # of Images       Optimal Output Size:
 ------------   -------------    ------------------------
   256x256            1                  256x256
   256x256            2                  512x256 
   256x256            3                  512x512
   256x256            4                  512x512
   256x256            5                  1024x512
   256x256            8                  1024x512
   256x256            9                  1024x1024
