Today you and your crew finally made port, returning home after many a moon trading abroad.  It was a long and treacherous journey; you braved the stormy seas, fought off two giant squid attacks, and escaped marauding pirates on three separate occasions, it had been the calmest trade voyage you had ever made!  It was finally time to deliver your cargo and collect your earnings.  While the crew began unloading you made your way to the central offices of the West India Trading Company, your sponsors.  It was there that Disaster finally struck!

The entire West India Trading Company has been bought out by your sworn rivals, the East India Trading Company!  Worse still, your entire ship's crew had been reassigned to the old Salt Mines!

With your entire world crumbling around you, you sought out another patron Trading Company, cargo doesn't buy itself after all!  Unfortunately, as soon became apparent, the East India Trading Company has bought out ALL of the Trading Contracts and has blacklisted the employees of their former competitors!

Jobless, destitute, with no prospects on the horizons, you decide to form your own trading conglomerate!  First though, you need a little starting money, and where better to get starting money than a little honest piracy against the corporate monopoly?  It is time to set out on your first voyage as an Entrepreneur.
